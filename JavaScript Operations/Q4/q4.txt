
Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts
important?

In JavaScript, the precedence and associativity of operators determine the order in which operations are performed when multiple operators are used in an expression. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing correct and predictable code. Here's an overview:

    Precedence:

        Definition: Precedence refers to the priority of operators. It determines which operators are evaluated first in an expression.

        Example:

        javascript

let result = 5 + 3 * 2; // Multiplication has higher precedence than addition
console.log(result); // Output: 11 (3 * 2 is evaluated first, then added to 5)

Common Precedence Levels (from highest to lowest):

    Unary operators (e.g., !, ++, --)
    Multiplication, division, and modulus (*, /, %)
    Addition and subtraction (+, -)
    Comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, instanceof, in)
    Equality operators (==, !=, ===, !==)
    Logical AND (&&)
    Logical OR (||)
    Conditional (Ternary) operator (? :)
    Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)

Use of Parentheses:
Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and explicitly specify the order of evaluation.

javascript

    let result = (5 + 3) * 2; // Parentheses force addition to be evaluated first
    console.log(result); // Output: 16

Associativity:

    Definition: Associativity refers to the direction in which operators with the same precedence are evaluated. It can be left-to-right or right-to-left.

    Example:

    javascript

let result = 10 - 5 - 2; // Left-to-right associativity
console.log(result); // Output: 3 (10 - 5 is evaluated first, then subtracted by 2)

Common Associativity Direction:

    Most operators in JavaScript have left-to-right associativity.
    The assignment operators (=) have right-to-left associativity.

javascript

let a = b = 5; // Right-to-left associativity
console.log(a, b); // Output: 5 5
