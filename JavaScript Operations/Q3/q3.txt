Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

In JavaScript, operators can be categorized based on the number of operands they operate on. Here's the differentiation between unary, binary, and ternary operators, along with examples for each:

    Unary Operators:
        Definition: Unary operators are operators that work with only one operand.
        Example:

        javascript

    // Unary Plus (+)
    let num = 5;
    let result = +num; // Unary plus converts its operand to a number
    console.log(result); // Output: 5

    // Unary Negation (-)
    let negResult = -num; // Unary negation negates its operand
    console.log(negResult); // Output: -5

    // Increment (++)
    let x = 10;
    x++; // Increment operator increases the value by 1
    console.log(x); // Output: 11

    // Decrement (--)
    let y = 8;
    y--; // Decrement operator decreases the value by 1
    console.log(y); // Output: 7

Binary Operators:

    Definition: Binary operators are operators that work with two operands.
    Example:

    javascript

    // Addition (+)
    let sum = 5 + 3; // Adds two operands
    console.log(sum); // Output: 8

    // Subtraction (-)
    let difference = 8 - 3; // Subtracts the right operand from the left operand
    console.log(difference); // Output: 5

    // Multiplication (*)
    let product = 4 * 3; // Multiplies two operands
    console.log(product); // Output: 12

    // Division (/)
    let quotient = 16 / 4; // Divides the left operand by the right operand
    console.log(quotient); // Output: 4

Ternary Operator:

    Definition: The ternary operator is a conditional operator that takes three operands.
    Syntax: condition ? expr1 : expr2
    Example:

    javascript

// Ternary Operator (conditional operator)
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
console.log(status); // Output: 'Adult'
