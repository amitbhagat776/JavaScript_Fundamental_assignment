Q3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
JavaScript has five primitive data types:

    1.Number: Numbers represent numerical values, including integers and floating-point numbers. Examples of numbers include:
        10;
        3.14;
        -20;

    2.String: Strings represent sequences of characters. Examples of strings include:
        "Hello, world!";
        "I am a string";
        "123456";

    3.Boolean: Booleans represent logical values that are either true or false. Examples of boolean values include:
        true;
        false;

    4.Null: Null is a special value that represents the absence of a value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing. Examples of null include:
        null;
        
    5.Undefined: Undefined is a special value that represents an uninitialized value. Examples of undefined include:
        undefined;
        var a;
        var obj = {};
        obj.a;
        obj.b;
