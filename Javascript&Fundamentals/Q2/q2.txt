Q2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

JavaScript and HTML are both essential components of web development, but they serve distinct purposes and have fundamental differences.


HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is a markup language that defines the structure and content of a web page. It consists of tags and attributes that instruct the browser on how to display the content.
    
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Web Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
      <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
    </body>
    </html>


    JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows for manipulating the content of the page, responding to user actions, and creating animations.
function changeColor() {
  const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
  element.style.color = 'red';
}
