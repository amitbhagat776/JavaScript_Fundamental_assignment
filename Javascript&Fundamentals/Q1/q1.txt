Q1.Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.?
A: 
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It is used on both the client-side and server-side to add interactivity to web pages and make them more dynamic.
Role in Web Development

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks in web development, including:
    Adding interactivity to web pages: JavaScript can be used to create dynamic effects such as rollovers, pop-ups, and animations.
    Validating user input: JavaScript can be used to check that user input is valid before submitting it to a server.
    Making AJAX requests: JavaScript can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to a server, which can be used to update a web page without reloading it.
    Building single-page applications (SPAs): JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js can be used to build SPAs, which are web applications that load a single HTML page and then dynamically update the page as the user interacts with it.
    Developing server-side applications: JavaScript can be used to develop server-side applications with Node.js, which is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.


Benefits of Using JavaScript
There are many benefits to using JavaScript in web development, including:
    Cross-platform compatibility: JavaScript can be run on all major web browsers, making it a very versatile language for web development.
    Large community: JavaScript has a large and active community of developers, which means that there is a wealth of resources available for learning and using the language.
    Relative ease of learning: JavaScript is a relatively easy language to learn, especially for those who have experience with other programming languages.
